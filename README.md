# SCSS and Sass syntax for Sublime Text 3

Includes completions for CSS properties and values, as well as relevant Sass functions.

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

Syntax highlighting should be very similar to [CSS](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/tree/master/CSS) and [LESS](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime) (which is maintained in parallel).
